<code>ui5-icon</code> component represents an SVG icon.\n * There are two main scenarios how the <code>ui5-icon</code> component is used:\n * as a purely decorative element; or as a visually appealing clickable area in the form of an icon button.\n * <br><br>\n * A large set of built-in icons is available\n * and they can be used by setting the <code>name</code> property on the <code>ui5-icon</code>.\n * But before using an icon, you need to import the desired icon.\n * <br>\n *\n * For the standard icon collection, you have to import an icon from the <code>@ui5/webcomponents-icons</code> package:\n * <br>\n * <code>import \"@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/employee.js\";</code>\n * <br>\n *\n * For the SAP Fiori Tools icon collection (supported since 1.0.0-rc.10), you have to import an icon from the <code>@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt</code> package:\n * <br>\n * <code>import \"@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt/dist/antenna.js\";</code>\n *\n * <br><br>\n * <h3>Keyboard Handling</h3>\n *\n * <ul>\n * <li>[SPACE, ENTER, RETURN] - Fires the <code>click</code> event if the <code>interactive</code> property is set to true.</li>\n * <li>[SHIFT] - If [SPACE] or [ENTER],[RETURN] is pressed, pressing [SHIFT] releases the ui5-icon without triggering the click event.</li>\n * </ul>\n * <br><br>\n *\n * <h3>ES6 Module Import</h3>\n *\n * <code>import \"@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Icon.js\";</code>\n *\n * @constructor\n * @author SAP SE\n * @alias sap.ui.webcomponents.main.Icon\n * @extends sap.ui.webcomponents.base.UI5Element\n *

The Popup class handles modality:\n *  - The \"isModal\" getter can be overridden by derivatives to provide their own conditions when they are modal or not\n *  - Derivatives may call the \"blockBodyScrolling\" and \"unblockBodyScrolling\" static methods to temporarily remove scrollbars on the body\n *  - Derivatives may call the \"open\" and \"close\" methods which handle focus, manage the popup registry and for modal popups, manage the blocking layer\n *\n *  2. Provides blocking layer (relevant for modal popups only):\n *   - It is in the static area\n *   - Controlled by the \"open\" and \"close\" methods\n *\n * 3. The Popup class \"traps\" focus:\n *  - Derivatives may call the \"applyInitialFocus\" method (usually when opening, to transfer focus inside the popup)\n *\n * 4. The Popup class automatically assigns \"z-index\"\n *  - Each time a popup is opened, it gets a higher than the previously opened popup z-index\n *\n * 5.

size-limited window in front of the regular app screen.\n * It is used to prompt the user for an action or a confirmation.\n * The <code>ui5-dialog</code> interrupts the current app processing as it is the only focused UI element and\n * the main screen is dimmed/blocked.\n * The dialog combines concepts known from other technologies where the windows have\n * names such as dialog box, dialog window, pop-up, pop-up window, alert box, or message box.\n * <br><br>\n * The <code>ui5-dialog</code> is modal, which means that user action is required before returning to the parent window is possible.\n * The content of the <code>ui5-dialog</code> is fully customizable.\n *\n * <h3>Structure</h3>\n * A <code>ui5-dialog</code> consists of a header, content, and a footer for action buttons.\n * The <code>ui5-dialog</code> is usually displayed at the center of the screen.\n * Its position can be changed by the user. To enable this, you need to set the property <code>draggable</code> accordingly.\n\n *\n * <h3>Responsive Behavior</h3>\n * The <code>stretch</code> property can be used to stretch the\n * <code>ui5-dialog</code> on full screen.\n *\n * <h3>ES6 Module Import</h3>\n *\n * <code>import \"@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Dialog\";</code>\n *\n * <b>Note:</b> We don't recommend nesting popup-like components (<code>ui5-dialog</code>, <code>ui5-popover</code>) inside <code>ui5-dialog</code>.\n * Ideally you should create all popups on the same level inside your HTML page and just open them from one another, rather than nesting them.\n *\n * <b>Note:</b> We don't recommend nesting popup-like components (<code>ui5-dialog</code>, <code>ui5-popover</code>) inside other components containing z-index.\n * This might break z-index management.\n *\n * @constructor\n * @author SAP SE\n * @alias sap.ui.webcomponents.main.Dialog\n * @extends Popup\n * @tagname ui5-dialog\n * @public\n */\nclass

<code>ui5-button</code> UI, you can define text, icon, or both. You can also specify\n * whether the text or the icon is displayed first.\n * <br><br>\n * You can choose from a set of predefined types that offer different\n * styling to correspond to the triggered action.\n * <br><br>\n * You can set the <code>ui5-button</code> as enabled or disabled. An enabled\n * <code>ui5-button</code> can be pressed by clicking or tapping it. The button changes\n * its style to provide visual feedback to the user that it is pressed or hovered over with\n * the mouse cursor.
